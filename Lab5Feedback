-make it without javascript. site is tested with JS turned off. therefore, make mobile menu default to open and to not need js

-elaborated on the concept…do the fine details (confirmation pages,..) more complete experience, we have more attention so expect more attention to be paid


-templates: how many? 
—major chunks of functionality visible
—-more than what was in the styleGuide

-what are the slots that stuff can stick into?
—achieves generality by not being content specific

-learning experience by applying styleGuide..and see if it makes sense
